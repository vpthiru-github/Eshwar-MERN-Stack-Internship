USEREDUCER:
	Same as usestate to manage or update states that is data that is values of components.

step1: create increment decrement program using usestate

step2: replace usestate with use reducer

note:
point1: usereducer takes 2 arguments first is reducerfunction which says what u want to do (like increment or decrement),second is initial value of state.
point2: usereducer returns array with two values like usestate.
	first is that initial count and second is dispatch function we call them as *state and dispatch*
	Here state will hold initial value and updated once u call dispatch function and dispatch will trigger user reduction function.
	(---now this state will hold that initial value and updated once u call dispatch reducerfunction will be triggered)


q1: get a password from the user as input ,if the password is correct display the component ,display login granted, if the password is incorrect, display access denied components.
