react component with redux.

using useContext hook

complicated. so gonna use router example and use redux in that to manage state 


INSTALL ROUTER
npm i react-router-dom

ROUTER ARCHITECTURE
(=> represents inside)
 router => inside router routes => route => path => route => routes => router.

task:
step 1: create this using routing home using about contact.


setting up redux:

create 2 folders for the above under src 1.app for store 2.slices for slices

step2: inside slices folder create a file called userslice.js 

step3: create a file store.js in app

now Redux setup is ready , go ahead connect redux with react

now we have to make changes in useSelector hook - TO access data from redux


explanation:
state is reducer userinfo from store user from slice
consr user-useSelect ((state)=>state.userinfo.user);
here state is call back function u can write (states)
