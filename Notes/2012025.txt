state: which means data
usestate returns an array of two values (initial state and updated state)
updated state is a function

lets say we have five components: named as c1,c2....
now passing the props



c1 child is c2,c2's child is c3, c3,s chid is c4...
every component should display its name as message.
display them by size wise h1 to h5  

while exporting there can be any error so if one approach is not working then use another approach.

for efficiency we are using oops.
for passing value.
the only way to achieve passing props in hierarchy

this is not efficient, to make it efficient we have an exclusive ,use context.
four component: app, container, users, user.

tWO 	IMPORTANT THING WHILE USING context:
*creating context.
*use context

In the given example create context will be done in app component and that will be used in user component using used context. 

Synchronizing A component with external system after our action monitoring or seeing the side effects happening in the functional components is possible using use effect hook.
