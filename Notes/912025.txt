components: class component and functional component
earlier in it industry they were using class component reason we state concept was not available with function components
Hooks is used to implement state in functional components
Types:
1, use State
2, use Effect
3, use Ref
4, use Context 
5, use Reducer 

Best Example of use State : counter clock
Stating the initial state as  zero we can increment it decrement it reset  it using hook
