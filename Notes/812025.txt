q1) write a promise - db 
 persons - A,B,C
distance andra to A - 5000
Andhra to B - 2000
Andhra to C - 1000

Expected output :
A will reach home first, then B, then C.

when there the is more than one promise in order to review them we can use promise inbuilt methods according to the requirements
methods: promise.all , promise.any, promise.allsettled, promise.race.

Promise ALL:
once it sees promise false it will stop 
Promise ANY:
gives the shortest time promise provided status should be true
Promise ALLSETTLED:
will display one among these three states or results:
1, fulfill
2, rejected
3, pending

study react.
REACT:
It is a library or frame work of JavaScript example: Netflix and Amazon
html websites you tube .

to use react:
step1: create a new folder called react in desktop.
step2: open command prompt type the cd "path of the folder".
step3: node -v to check version, npm -v to find the version.
	commands used in command prompt:
	* npx create-react-app appname demo (here app name demo)
	* npm start
	*npm i web-vitals if npm doesn't start.
		open your app at port 3000
to make it work
1.open your react folder
	u will see your app folder got created.

step 4: to open the demo in vs code. go to your cmd enter command: cd demo (Enter)
								   code .



In react vscode: two important folders in react 1.public folder and 2.src
three important files:
index.html
index.js
index.css


as for now don't touch index files
initially do or write your code in app.js

dom
React follows virtual dom
unlike html here  once dom gets created the changes or manipulation what we do gets completed and only that part will be rerendured 
where as in html every time we make change entire dom will be rerendured.

Web-application:
when web application created by reactjs each and everything is called as components
components:
1.Functional components.
2.class components.
